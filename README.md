# Spring Authorization Server
The Spring Authorization Server project, led by the [Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security/) team, is focused on delivering [OAuth 2.1 Authorization Server](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-07#section-1.1) support to the Spring community.

This project replaces the Authorization Server support provided by [Spring Security OAuth](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security-oauth/).

# Feature Planning
This project uses [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects) to prioritize the feature roadmap and help organize the project plan. The project board can be accessed [here](https://github.com/orgs/spring-projects/projects/8).

The feature list can be viewed in the [reference documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-authorization-server/docs/current/reference/html/overview.html#feature-list).

# Support Policy
The Spring Authorization Server project provides software support through the [VMware Tanzu OSS support policy](https://tanzu.vmware.com/spring-runtime). [Commercial support](https://tanzu.vmware.com/spring-runtime), which offers an extended support period, is also available from VMware.
